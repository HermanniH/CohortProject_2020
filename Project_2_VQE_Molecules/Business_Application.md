# Improving Fertilizer Production Using Quantum Computing
<!--- # Quantum Computing For a Better Fertilizer Production --->
<!---  # Could the Quantum Computing Revolution Help Feed the World?  --->


Synthetic fertilizers have sustained the population growth in the past century since they were introduced in 1914, and fertilizer production is expected to increase in the coming decades to feed an ever-growing world population (Fig. 1). [1,2] Fertilizer manufacture is an energy-intensive industry. It has been estimated that fertilizer production accounts for approximately 1.2% of the world's energy, of which about 93% is consumed by nitrogen-based fertilizers. [3,4] Unlike two other essential soil nutrients, phosphorous and potassium, nitrogen does not persist in the soil long after application, making frequent reapplication of nitrogen-based fertilizers necessary.

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

One of the fundamental technical challenges in physics and chemistry is to accurately calculate the potential energy surfaces (PESs) for small molecules. Although there exists some approximation techniques using classical computational methods, these are limited to cases that have less bonds (i.e. 1 or 2 bonds such as LiH and H4 respectively) and for weakly correlated systems. But why do we need PES in the first place? Through the accurate computing of PES value, we can control many real world applications such as the breaking of N2 bonds to make NH3. Subsequently, the breaking of the NH3 bonds can serve the agricultural sector in producing fertilizers while the energy released from the bond-breaking process can be employed to supply energy demand.  The importance of quantum computing lies in the ability to accurately compute PES for small molecules with highly correlated electronic structure systems while reducing time complexity, which is deemed essential in real world applications. 


## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve
 (Maybe we may still need to add one or two sentences explaining potential benefits under each bullet or at least mention relevant references) 
-	Energy sector through generating energy from breaking molecular bonds 
-	Agricultural sector through fertilizers 
-	Material Simulation (electronic structure to find advanced materials) 
-	Battery Optimization 
-	Finance and Portfolio Management to maximize profit/wealth and minimize risk [6]. 


## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP Group) is a viable customer to efficiently employ phosphates resources. OCP group is based in Morocco and has 70% of the worldâ€™s phosphate raw reserves, which are essential for production of fertilizers world-wide. Additionally, it is a profitable market which allowed the company to yield a net profit of US$5.88 billion revenue. The OCP group would be of particular interest to the application of VQEs because nitrogen is central to their fertilizer production, thus the profitable outcome of this innovative technique will maximize their revenues through employing this newest technology to remain in the lead in this competitive industry. Fortunately, they are heavily involved in R&D by investing massively in new technologies such as their most recent investment in artificial intelligence in 2018 [7,8,9]. 

The Teal Technology Services was a recent joint venture between the OCP group and IBM for smart farming and to accelerate the digital transformation of their clients. Given that IBM owns the VQE quantum computing technology while the OCP group is the leading manufacturers of fertilizer; this will serve as the is the ideal opportunity to reinforce their relations as the OCP group will highly benefits of IBM VQE technology and vice versa. [10]


## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Video (Due Saturday!).
